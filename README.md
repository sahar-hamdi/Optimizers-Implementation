# Optimizers-Implementation

1- Load MNSIT Dataset from sklearn

2- Preprocessing data using python libraries

3- Subset data to use only class 0 and class 1 for the next steps.

4- Standardize dataset.

5- Divide data into training and validation set.

6- Implement Logistic Regression with L1 Regularization.

7- calculate accuracy after applying L1 using different values for lampdas and learning rates.

8- Implement Logistic Regression with Mini Batch Optimizer.

9- calculate accuracy after applying Mini Batch using different values for lampdas and learning rates.

10- Implement Logistic Regression with RMS Prop Optimizer.

11- Calculate Accuracy after applying RMS.

12- Implement Logistic Regression with Adam Optimizer.

13- Calculate Accuracy after Applying Adam.

14- I wrote some conclusions for each case using Barplot.
